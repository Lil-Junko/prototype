# prototype
A prototype build of a game for testing and all that

## Gameplay Expectation
Recreate the deep sea knight fight from black souls 2
scripted three layer fight with tile movement and rpg fighing systems

### Deep Sea Knight
deep sea knight has a 2x2 box and can hit in a 2x radius around him
only can move 1 space at a time
heavy attack will instant kill player but requires a wind up, but creates a hole in the ground where it hits
a hole in the ground cannot be walked into, instant kills player
light attack knocks the player back, covers a large area
fight 1 does not enter phase 2
fight 2 enters phase 2 at half health
fight 3 starts in phase 2
phase 2:
shrugs off damage less than 5
gains:
weak ranged attack called "Carpenter's song" stuns player skipping one turn cooldown of 3 turns
buff called "walrus's blessing" boosts speed, defense, and attack for 3 turns cooldown of 5 turns
after using walrus's blessing should have the Deep Sea Knight able to hit a crushing anchor after 1 turn meaning player can't leave his range and will get hit with it if player does not attempt to dodge or stun
